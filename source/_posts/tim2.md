Tim: Everybody?

Stu: What about the strippers?

Rondey: Uh,yeah,they all called in sick.

Tim: All 20?

Rondey: They said there's some kind of flu bug going around. You know,there was some kind of,like,virtus that was stuck to the pole. Then when they rubbed their junk on it,they all got sick.

Tim: I guess that's the way is goes.

Stu: I read about that online.

tuner: Yo yo yo yo yo yo,gentlemen.

Tim: Yo?

tuner: You ready to get this party started?

Tim: I don't think we are,actually.

Rondey: Yes! Please, let's do it. When people finally get here I want this thing to be cracking.

Stu: He got so angry.

Tim: Got to be top 10.

Rondey: Guys, I'm getting in cage and I'm taking off my shirt.

Tim: Oh,no

Stu: Oh,God.

Tim: No, this is not what people do at bachelor parties.

Rondey: This is what I'm doing right now.

tuner: One motherfucker in the house getting it.

tuner: Caged heat! Caged heat!

Tim: Rodney, I'm begging with you get out of that cage.

Rodney: Why,man? I'm digging this.

Tim: If people show up --

Stu: You're dancing in acage for two guys. All right? This is not your traditional straight man's bachelor party.

Rodney: All right,all right. Cut the music,cut the music.

Tim: Wow, that was incredibly awkward.

Rodney: Man,this is depressing.

Tim: That never happened,okay?

Rodney: No one showed up but you guys.

Stu: I know, and I don't even want to be here.

Rodney: I know that I'm loud and obnoxious...

Stu: True

Rodney: ... and grab people and stuff. But, I don't know. I thought people liked me.

Tim: Rodney,some people like you.

Stu: People know who you are.

Tim: Yeah,you're well-known.

Rodney: Dude,I'm kind of embarrassed to go to work tomorrow. What am I gonna tell everybody?

Tim: We'll make up stories. How's that sound? Make it sound like a crazy fun parth. All your friends were here and everyone will wish they came.

Rodney: You guys would do that for me?

Tim: Yeah,who cares? Yeah

Stu: I don't give a shit.

Tim: All right

Rodney: All right. Yeah,I'm on this,man. Okay, I got it, I got it.

Rodney: Stu,you greaesd up two chicks in the cage and had your way with them while someone was videotaping. It'll be on YouTube next week.

Stu: I can't wait to see the footage.

Rodney: And me,uh, the bartender gave me this look and I was like "what?" And he was like "waht?" And then I kicked his ass.

Tim: That's pretty good. That sounds like a fun party. How about me? What did I do?

Rodney: Oh,oh,Timbo,you just threw up all over yourself and then you went home early.

Tim: What? No.

Rodney: It's perfect.

Tim: No,give me a good story. Give me something with a stripper.

Stu: You puked on a stripper.

Tim: Why am I puking at all?

Rodney: It fits you.

Tim: No,it doesn't.

Rodney: Totally. Like a glove.

Tim: Let's do something with me in the cage with like a --

Rodney: I got it. Tim drank too much and took a dump in his pants.

Rodney: Oh,perfect

Tim: I don't like this story. I don't like the general themes you're exploring.

Stu: Tim, if we exaggerate no one will believe us.

Rodney: It has to be authentic to you, who you are around the office and stuff.

Tim: That's who I am?

Stu: Yeah. Remember, we're doing this for Rodney.

Rodney: Yeah,come on,Tim.

Tim: Let's just come up with a good one for me.

Rodney: All right, Tim,You know what? Let me sleep on it and I'll have something good for you in the morning.

Tim: Something fun?

Rodney: Fun,exciting, You know,but authentic.

Rondey: Oh,dude,you should've been there. It was like midgets everywhere.

Alan: Oh my god.

Rodney: And you should have seen Stu.

Alan: Yeah?

Rodney: He's in this cage with this chick that's dressed up like a cheetah and he's like in this safari outfit but he's got like this big tub of Vaseline and he's just like rubbing it all over and making out with her. You know what I mean?
And I was just getting mine too. It was cool.

passer: Oh,man, I always miss the --

Tim: Hey. The boss wants to see me? Is that true?

Rodney: Yeah,yeah. You can head right in.

Tim: All right. Sorry for interrupting.

passer: Hey, Tim

Tim: Yeah?

passer: It's gonna be okay,man. I mean,I -- just keep your head up high.

Tim: All right.

Boss: Ah,Timothy.

Tim: Yes?

Boss: Come in,come in. Close the door too,please.

Tim: Close the door?

Boss: Yeah,shut the door.

Tim: Okay.

Boss: Sit down,please. Or don't sit. You don't have to sit.

Tim: I'll stand.

Boss: Great.

Boss: Hi

Tim: Hey.

Boss: I understand you attended Rodney's bachelor party last night.

Tim: Oh,that. Yeah,we had a good time.

Boss: Really? You had a great time?

Tim: So much fun.

Boss: Huh

Tim: Rodney had a lot of friends there.

Boss: Right

Tim: It got pretty nuts. A lot of good close friends.

Boss: Listen, I'm all for some light-hearted shenanigans,but I have to say that I'm a little concerned about you in particular.

Tim: What did -- I was just at the party.

Boss: Hmm,really?

Tim: Yeah.

Boss: I'm hearing a couple of stories and your story strikes me as just a little freaky.

Tim: My story?

Boss: Yeah.

Tim: Did I,um-- did I do something with a stripper? I don't even remember.

Boss: No no.

Tim: What did I do?

Boss: Well,it's my understanding that you were raped by a bum.

Tim: Come again?

Boss: Raped by a bum.

Tim: No,no, my story -- I kicked some guy's ass.

Boss: No,you were reped by a bum.

Tim: And I went home with a stripper.

Boss: I'm sorry. I'm confused. Are you saying Rodney's a liar?

Tim: Um ...  can I have a minute?

Tim: Rodney?

Rodney: Yeah?

Tim: Raped by a bum?

Rodney: Right in the backside. You know what I mean?

Tim: That's not a good story.

Rodney: Why not,man? It fits you.

Tim: It fits me?

Rodney: Yeah,you're like a frail guy. I can see like some homeless drunk taking advantage of you.

Tim: No,it's not a good story.

Rodney: If you're not into it -- 

Tim: Get in there,tell him the truth.

Rodney: Okay,fine.

Rodney: Yeah,I'm a good storyteller. Tim, I'll rework it.

Tim: Let's rework it a lot.

Rodney: Yeah.

Rodney: Hey, boss. Uh, I wanted to clear something up with you.

Boss: Yes, Rodney,go.

Rodney: You're not gonna believe this,but there was a misunderstanding between you and me earlier.

Boss: Oh?

Rodney: This is crazy. Tim wasn't reped by a bum.

Boss: He -- he wasn't raped?

Rodney: No, I thought I made this clear, but he actually bought drapes for a bum.

Boss: Draped? You bought drapes for a bum?

Tim: I did. I bought drapes. I,um--

Rodney: He left the party and -- 

Tim: I just cut out and went to Bloomingdale's 

Boss: I don't believe you.

Tim: You don't believe me?

Boss: No, I don't believe either of you.

Rodney: Okay.

Tim: Okay? What happened?

Boss: Rodney.

Rodney: What?

Boss: It's very noble of you to try and cover for Tim, but the reality is a bum stuck his penis inside of Tim. That much has been established. It's clear.

Tim: Let's not lock that down just yet.

Boss: Tim,It's been established.

Tim: Please stop saying that.

Boss: No,it's true.It happened.

Tim: That did not -- the details of it--

Rodney: He bought drapes.

Boss: Tim, I'm sending you to Human Resources for some mandatory counseling.

Tim: Counseling?

Boss: Counseling.

Boss: Marie

Tim: Don't bother Marie.

Boss: I'm sending Tim down your way.

Marie: Because he was raped by a bum last night?

Boss: Exactly

Marie: All right

Tim: Wow, word travels fast.

Tim: Hey,Marie

Marie: Tim,how are you?

Tim: Doing all right.

Marie: I have a couple of questions.

Tim: All right,ley's just --

Marie: We'll just wrap this up.

Tim: Yeah.

Marie: And then you can put this entire ordeal behind you ...

Tim: That's what I --

Marie: So to speak.

TIm: Behind me.

Marie: Just a little bum-rape humor. I'm sorry.

Tim: Bum rape humor? That's not a genre of humor.

Marie: Anyway, if you could describe exactly what happened between you and this homeless man.

Tim: To be prefectly honest ...

Marie: Yes,please.

Tim: It never happened. The event did not take place.

Marie: Tim,you're in denial.

Tim: No,I'm coming clean.

Marie: No. You continue to say no. That's an indication of denial.

Tim: No.

Marie: No,See? It's right there.

Marie: Tim, I'm worried. I'm afraid this man could strike again.

Tim: No,let's just assume that's not gonna happen.

Marie: We can't take the chance. I'm gonna need to contact the police.

Tim: He seemed like a good guy. Don't bug him.

Marice: I need to call the cops right now.

Tim: No,no,don't call them.

Marie: Tim,it's Omnicorp policy.

Tim: Omnicorp has a policy on bum rape?

Marie: My hands are tied ... as I'm sure yours were. hahahahaha, I'm sorry.

Tim: You should not be the HR lady. You really should not.

Marie: Oh,man,Yeah.

police-1: Hey,Tim. Thanks for coming by.

Tim: Okay.

police-1: Listen,we rounded up all the homeless men within a live-block radius of the crime site. All we need is a positive ID of this bum and you can be on your way back home,okay?

Tim: Whatever puts this to an end.

police-1: Great. Bum number one, please reenact the crime.

bum-1: Uh, what do I do?

police-1: You've got to pretend you're having sexual relationships with this man.

bum-1: With this guy? Can I touch him?

police-1: Can you touch him?

Tim: No,no.

police-1: That might be good for you,Tim.

Tim: No.

police-1: It's very realistic to be touched. Maybe that'll help.

plice-1: You know what? Yes,touch him, bum.

bum-1: All right.

Tim: That's really the way you do there thing?

bum-1: Here we go.

Tim: No.it's not him.It's not the guy.Let's get number two.

police-1: That's not the guy?

Tim: It's so not the guy.

police-1: Really,you sure?

Tim: I'm so positive.

police-1: Maybe it'll jog your memory if he took his clothes off.

Tim: No, that would not help.

police-1: Bum number one ... 

Tim: I want to go ...

police-1: Could you please get naked for us?

bum-1: All right

Tim: This is not how lineups usually work.

bum-1: That's better.

police-1: That doesn't help at all?

Tim: It doesm't.

police-1: You sure,Tim?

Tim: It was dark. It was behind a dumpster.

police-1: Look at his body.

bum-1: Yeah.

police-1: Get a good look at his body,Tim.

Tim: My face was in the dirt.

police-2: whoa,hey,Excuse me.

police-2: Sergant,we have a development on this case here.

police-1: What's the development?

Tim: Development?

police-2: We got the security tape from the crime site. It's pretty revealing.

police-1: why do you keep talking? Put it in.

police-2: All right.

Tim: Security rape?

Tim: Who's that?

police-1: Looks like you,Tim.

Tim: Those taped are so grainy.

... ...


police-1: I got a question for you,Tim.

Tim: Yeah?

police-1: There was no bum rape,was there?

Tim: You know what? I've got to come clean here. There was no bum rape. It never happened.

Tim: I'm glad we settled this.

police-2: Never happened?

Tim: Sorry to inconvenience you guys.I'll be on my way.

police-1: Oh,no.

Tim: And sorry to inconvenience the bums.

police-1: no,no,no, It's not gonna happen,like that,Tim.

Tim: No? 

police-1: No. What was this?

Tim: What do you mean?

police-1: Was this your 15 minutes of fame?

Tim: Fame? No

police-1: Yeah,you want to be on "60 Minutes"? You wanna go, "Oh,look at me,I'm Tim". I'm the guy who got raped by a bum.

Tim: No, That's the opposite of what I want.

police-1: Want to shank hands with Oprah Winfrey?

Tim: Not radlly.

police-1: You wanna go on "The view"

Tim: No no. I'd like for this to fly under the radar.

police-1: No,you're gonna get your wish,sonny boy.

Tim: Iam?

police-1: You're getting your big old wish.

Tim: No,please don't give me my wish.

police-1: I'm gonna give you a wish. Either go on TV or you're going in jail. Your choice, Timmy.

Tim: Those aren't good choices.

60 Minutes: Tonight on "60 Minutes" ... the Chinese economy shows no signs of slowing but at what cost to the environment? Then a one-on-one with Tim who was raped by a bum behind a filthy dumpster.

Tim: What was it like? Anyone that;s been raped by a bum knows the drill. He pretty much took his pants off and went crazy.

Amy: Waht the fuck?

Tim: Did I not tell you that story.
