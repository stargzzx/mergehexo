Boss: Ah, Timothy, come on in.

Tim: Hey, boss.

Boss: I have a small favor to ask of you.

Tim: Okay.

Boss: If the firm ever gets audited,if you ever find yourself under direct interrogation by a government official.

Tim: Yeah?

Boss: I need you --

Tim: I don't like where this is going.

Boss: I need you to say your name is Tim Sanchez and that --

Tim: What?

Boss: and you are the VP of North American Sales.

Tim: That's a small favor?

Boss: Tim Sanchez.

Tim: Why would I say that?

Boss: There watchdog groups are saying we don't have enough minorities in upper management.

Tim: Yeah,but I'm not Hispanic in any way. You realize that,right?

Boss: Listen,It's just a technicality.

Tim: Yeah

Boss: It's paperwork for books.

Tim: If that's all it is,what do I actually do?

Boss: You just sit there,you look Mexican.

Tim: And then I go home.

Boss: And you continue to look Mexican.

Tim: It sounds easy, but I don't picture this ending well.

Boss: Thanks for the chat,Tim.

Tim: Amy?

Amy: Yeah?

Tim: It's the day we've been waiting for.

Amy: How so?

Tim: I got the promotion...

Amy: Tim

Tim: ...big time.

Amy: Come on, you tell me that all the time and then it just never works out.

Tim: Amy,you ready for this? You're looking at the VP of North American Sales at Omnicorp.

Amy: From assistant to VP of Sales?

Tim: Straight--straight to the North American VP.

Amy: Why you?

Tim: They like my look.

Amy: Your look?

Tim: They singled me out from the crowd and said,"That guy,let's fast-track him to the top."

Amy: Well,I mean, then we need to celebrate,right?

Tim: Let's go out. I'll take you out.

Amy: Oh,how about that cute little French place?

Tim: How about any Mexican place?

Tim: All the executives eat Mexican. That's what I'm learning.

Boss: Oh,is that my new Hispanic VP of North American sales with his feet up on the desk.

Tim: Hey,boos.

Boss: Doing one heck of a job,Tim,I have to say.

Tim: I am.

Boss: Great job in your position.

Tim: I'm not doing anything but --

Boss: Yeah,but you really -- you look very Mexican.Keep up the good work.

Tim: I'll -- I'll do my best.

Boss: Listen, We want some pubilcity out of this...

Tim: Okay.

Boss: so we need you to arrend a dinner tonight.

Tim: No

Boss: Yes -- for the newly-appointed minority business leaders of America.

Boss: Dah-dah-dah-dah!

Tim: Yeah,um--

Boss: So you just sit in a crowd,they'll say your name and you'll just wave.

Tim: I'll just wave.

Boss: Yeah,just wave and look vaguely Latnio.

Tim: This is a very easy job.

Boss: It's prefect for you.

Toastmaster: Well,welcome everybody.Um, first order of business we're sticking with NAMBLA. Just letting you konw. Well,we spent quite a bit of money in letterhead, so we're just -- we're backing that play for right now. But basically,we're here to applaud Omnicorp for not only promoting an African-American as it's CEO,but for now promoting a Latino as its VP of sales. Let's get a little applause.That's what I'm talking about.

Boss: That's it. Just keep with the Mexican waving. That's good. You're doing great,Tim.

Toastmaster: Yeah! Now let's see if we can get Tim up here to say a few words.

Tim: Oh,no, I prefer to just wave.

Toastmaster: Get up here,you Hispanic son of a bitch.

Tim: No.

Toastmaster: Tim up here on the stage!

Tim: You know,I'd love to,but I do not habla ingles.

Toastmaster: Okay.

Tim: I do not speak your language.

Toastmaster: No problem. No problem.

Tim: No problem?

Toastmaster: We can get a translator up here.

Tim: No.

Boss: Do you speark spanish?

Tim: Um,a little. Enough to get through an inspirational speech probably.

Boss: Tremendous.

Toastmaster: Give it up for Timothy Sanchez.

...

Boss: All right,people,huddle up. We're in disaster mode here.

Boss: No one believes Tim is Hispanic.

People-1: I can't believe it.

Boss: This is a PR nightmare.

Boss: Okat,ideas, what do we do?

People-2: Well,Omnicorp could admit blame and issue a formal apology.

Boss: You're -- you're fired. Awful idea. Next.

People-3: I think I've got an idea.

Boss: Go.

People-3: He forged his work visa,this "Tim". He lied to all of us and the firm, and Omnicorp is absolutely shocked and appalled by this news and then just have the son of a bitch deported.

Boss: I love it.

Tim: No.

Boss: I did not think we'd find a solution this quickly. Let's fast-track that idea. Somebody call Immigration now.

Boss: Tim,call Immigration.

Tim: I'd rather not. Let;s keep thinking.

Boss: Tim,the deporting idea is great.

Tim: No

Boss: We ship you back to Mexico. The whole thing blows over. We can order lunch. It's win-win for everyone.

Tim: No,it's win-lose. I lose.

Boss: We win.

Tim: Yeah,Let's just hear everyone out.

Boss: I think we're heard it all.

Tim: Let's throw it all out.What's--

Boss: There are no more ideas. 

Tim: Charlie?

Charlie: I have an idea.

Boss: Oh,boy.

Tim: Let him talk.

Charlie: Okay,just listen to this.

Tim: He's got ideas.

Charlie: Yeah.

Boss: Nobody's stopping him.

Charlie: I suppose we could,umm...work out media connections...

Tim: That's great.

Charlie: and we could send him on a cable news show, put a Latino wife by his side. and that should convince most people.

Tim: That's good.

Boss: That could work.

Boss: Tim...

Tim: Yeah?

Boss: Can you find a fake Latino wife by tomorrow night?

Tim: Can I?

Tim: I can find one or my name is not Tim Sanchez.

Boss: Youe name is not Tim Sanchez.

...

Tim: Here goes nothing.
