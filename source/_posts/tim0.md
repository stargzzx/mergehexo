<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Oh, Timothy here owes me $300.

<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> That's too much. That's just too much money.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Well,for house calls my rate is $50 flat.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> That's fair.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Then,there's another $50 for a hurry-up-and-do-it-now rate.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Okay.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> And then you asked for the back-door action.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> No,no


<b style = 'color:green;'>Amy:</b> Back-door action?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> $200


<b style = 'color:green;'>Amy:</b> Tim,who are you?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Who am I?I'm not the back-door guy.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Yes,you are.You called and said,It's 9:00 a.m. Cock-a-doodle-doo. Send someone over for some back-door action at Tim's place.

<b style = 'color:green;'>Amy:</b> OKay,you know waht?We're not having this conversation.My parents are here for one night.I want her gone.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> All right.that's a good idea.Why don't you guys go into the kitchen,start preparing dinner? We'll settle up and we'll have a nice night.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Amy,I don't know if you noticed,I vacuumed.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Wow,that was not a good first impression.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Is it because I mentioned the back-door action?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> That didn't help,I got to say. Listen, I obviously called you by mistake...


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> No,you didn't.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> So if you could just leave.No hard feelings.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Okay,I won't have any hard feelings,When you cough up $300.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> How about a free dinner? Free meatloaf?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Sugar, I don't want meatloaf. I want money.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> I don't have it. I don't make that much.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Well,then I'm calling Maurice.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Maurice?

<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Mind if I sit here for about 20 minutes?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> You guys having fun? Enjoying yourselves?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Amy-mum:</b> It's meatloaf night.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> It is meatloaf night.

<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Uh,gone? No. Debble's not gone and just a quick FYI,Maurice is gonna join us. Should be fun. Catch up with you guys in a bit.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> This is not good. We only have four chairs.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Amy:</b> We always only have four chairs,Tim.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> I know. This is not good. Um...Would it be awkward if Debble sits on my lap?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Amy:</b> Um,yes it would.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> That would be awkward?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Amy:</b> Yes, it would be really awkward.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> who else--Can she sit on your dad's lap?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Amy:</b> No!


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> We got no choice. Do you want her to sit on your lap?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Amy:</b> Okay,you konw what? Fine,Just sit down.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Let's work with what we have.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Yeah,let's do it.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Mmm,two of my favorite things--meatloaf and giving a lap dance.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> No,no,stop doing that.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Up and down.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Stop the up and down.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Amy:</b> Tim,this is not a lap dance.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> I'm well aware.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Amy-dad:</b> So,Timothy.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Yeah?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Amy-dad:</b> You're the head of the household here. Would you like to say grace?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Grace? I would I love to say grace


<b style = 'color:green;'>Amy-dad:</b> Excellent


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Say a little prayer to the Lord.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Amy-mum:</b> Oh,how nice.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Lord,thank you for the blessings, you have bestowed upon us, we pray for health, we pray for happiness, and for the $300 I owe Maurice. We really are hoping for that to come through, If you could set that up. And,uh,we pray for understanding. as we all occasionally request back-door action by accident when we tried to call an electrician. It happens, It simply happens. And in your name we pray. Amen.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Amy-family:</b> Amen.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Amy-mum:</b> That was a very interesting prayer.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Thank you.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> All right,let's just do this. Let's just have a nice dinner.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Whoops, there's Maurice.That didn't last long.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Hello?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> You don't let me upstairs, I'm gonna take your head and shove it through your asshole.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Safe to assume that's Maurice?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> That's unmistakably Maurice.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> That's classic Maurice.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> I'm waiting down here.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Maurice,I'm buzzing you in.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Amy:</b> Who's Maurice?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Well, he says he works in financial retrieval,but that just means he's a pimp.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Amy:</b> Okay,we're leaving.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> You're leaving? What do you mean you're leaving? How's Maurice gonna feel?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Amy:</b> Mom,Dad ...


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> He just got here.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Amy:</b> Let's just go out for a nice dinner and then we'll get you back to your hotel.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> This is crazy.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Amy-mum:</b> It was a pleasure meeting you, Timothy.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> The pleasure was all mine.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Amy-dad:</b> If we never see each other again,son,good luck.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Never see each other again? What happened here?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> You know,I think you made a better impression than you think.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> You think I made a good impression?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Mmm-hmm,See,If you ask me, the fact that you vacuumed cancels out the back-door action.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> I don't think it cancels it.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Well, maybe it--Whoops.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> You got my money,bitch?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> What kind of entrance is that?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> I want cash in my hand.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> I don't have it.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> What?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> I don't have the money.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> Then we're gonna have to barter.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Barter?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> Let me see what I want in this place.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> No


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> TV sucks.


<b style = 'color:green;'>TIm:</b> You cann't have that.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> Furniture sucks. Man, I don't want any of this junk. This place is brat,yo.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> You want some meatloaf?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> What?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> I can give you half of meatloaf.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> Come on,man.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> You don't want it?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> NO.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> You're not being reasonable. You're really--


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> You better shut your mouth right now,son, and find my $300. You understand?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> All right.Um ...


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> How about some clothes? I can give you this shirt.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> Can you honestly picture me wearing a shirt like that?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> I can. No offense.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Your look is a little -- little expected.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> What did you say?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> I just said it's like a parody. If this was a TV sitcom,the pimp would look like you.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> Maybe you got a point.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> You know what? I think I do. Here,try my shirt on.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> All right.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Oh,that is precious.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> That's working.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> You konw what? I think this is a good look for me.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> That's a very good look.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> Yeah.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> You could be a pimp or a CPA.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> I look hard in this.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> It's nice.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> Check this angle. Bam!


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Bam.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> Feel that?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> Watch this. I could slap too in this thing. Bam!


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Bam!


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> Slap you up,bitch. Give me my money.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Okay.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> Feels good. Feels good.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> It looks good. It suits your job and your lifestyle.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> What you think,Debble? Do I look like a badass pimp?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Oh, with some nice chinos, I think you would.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> Those chino?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Mmm-hmm.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> There? You want this?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> Yeah.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Let's do it.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> Why don't you take them pants off?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> I'll take them off tight now if that makes this go away.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> That's a good look.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> I think this might be a good look for me. I don't know,you know?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> I mean,you don't find a lot of pimps shopping at The Gap ... or Banana Republic.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> You're right.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Tim, I think you did a very good job.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> I'm glad it worked out.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> You might have changed my life. I got a dream now. You know what I'm saying? I feel good in there things.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> This is emotional.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> You're a good guy.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Wow, you're not crying,are you?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> No,I'm not. I will shiv you quicker than you can blink.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> All right, obviously you're not crying.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Maurice:</b> I'm gonna show myself out.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> All right. That worked out. That's nice. Happy ending.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Or as I like to say, back to the meatloaf.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Should I put something on?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> No, I'm used to that look.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> This dinner really took a weird --  a weird turn.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Didn't it though?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Yeah.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Yeah, I think it's nice, though. You're a very good host.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Thank you.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> You know, Tim?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Yeah?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Most people have never treated me as nice as you have.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Well,I try to be nice.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Oh,you're very nice. Now I want to do something for you.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Okay.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> How about ... a half price BJ?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> No no


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Doesn't that sound fun?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> It actually does,but let's just not go there.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Okay,baby,I understand.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> How about a little peck on the cheek?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> You want to peck me on the cheek?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Yeah, or a hug?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> That seems pretty innocent.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Okay. Come here.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Let's do that.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Okay,that's not a peck.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Amy:</b> Tim?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Amy?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Debble:</b> Hello.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Amy:</b> What are you doing?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> What am I doing or how am I doing?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Amy:</b> What are you doing?


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> Listen, don't rush to judgment just because I'm nude and we're making out.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Amy:</b> Unbelievable.


<b style = 'color:green;'>Tim:</b> I vaccumed.
