Amy-family: Good lord,for what?

Tim: That's too much. That's just too much money.

Tim: No,no

Amy: Back-door action?

Debble: $200

Amy: Tim,who are you?

Tim: Who am I?I'm not the back-door guy.

Debble: Yes,you are.You called and said,It's 9:00 a.m. Cock-a-doodle-doo. Send someone over for some back-door action at Tim's place.

Tim: No,I did not say cock-a-doodle-doo.

Amy: OKay,you know waht?We're not having this conversation.My parents are here for one night.I want her gone.

Tim: All right.that's a good idea.Why don't you guys go into the kitchen,start preparing dinner? We'll settle up and we'll have a nice night.

Tim: Amy,I don't know if you noticed,I vacuumed.

Tim: Wow,that was not a good first impression.

Debble: Is it because I mentioned the back-door action?

Tim: That didn't help,I got to say. Listen, I obviously called you by mistake...

Debble: No,you didn't.

Tim: So if you could just leave.No hard feelings.

Debble: Okay,I won't have any hard feelings,When you cough up $300.

Tim: How about a free dinner? Free meatloaf?

Debble: Sugar, I don't want meatloaf. I want money.

Tim: I don't have it. I don't make that much.

Debble: Well,then I'm calling Maurice.

Tim: Maurice?

Debble: Maurice. I'm calling him now.

Tim: You're calling Maurice?

Debble: I'm calling Maurice.

Tim: unbelievable.

Debble: Quiet.

Tim: Just have Maurice send me an invoice.

Debble: Oh, don't try that,honey.

Tim: Have Maurice-- Okay.

Debble: Maurice! Yes, this is Debble. I'm here with a young gentleman who owes me $300 and he wants to pay with meatloaf.

Tim: Explain to him how she's gonna prepare it.

Debble: Quiet,sugar,Is that okay? ... All right. Bye sugar.

Tim: What did Manurice say? He's cool with that?

Debble: Maurice is coming over.

Debble: Mind if I sit here for about 20 minutes?

Tim: You guys having fun? Enjoying yourselves?

Amy-mum: It's meatloaf night.

Tim: It is meatloaf night.

Amy: Tim,is she gone?

Tim: Uh,gone? No. Debble's not gone and just a quick FYI,Maurice is gonna join us. Should be fun. Catch up with you guys in a bit.

Tim: This is not good. We only have four chairs.

Amy: We always only have four chairs,Tim.

Tim: I know. This is not good. Um...Would it be awkward if Debble sits on my lap?

Amy: Um,yes it would.

Tim: That would be awkward?

Amy: Yes, it would be really awkward.

Tim: who else--Can she sit on your dad's lap?

Amy: No!

Tim: We got no choice. Do you want her to sit on your lap?

Amy: Okay,you konw what? Fine,Just sit down.

Debble: Let's work with what we have.

Tim: Yeah,let's do it.

Debble: Mmm,two of my favorite things--meatloaf and giving a lap dance.

Tim: No,no,stop doing that.

Debble: Up and down.

Tim: Stop the up and down.

Amy: Tim,this is not a lap dance.

Tim: I'm well aware.

Amy-dad: So,Timothy.

Tim: Yeah?

Amy-dad: You're the head of the household here. Would you like to say grace?

Tim: Grace? I would I love to say grace

Amy-dad: Excellent

Tim: Say a little prayer to the Lord.

Amy-mum: Oh,how nice.

Tim: Lord,thank you for the blessings, you have bestowed upon us, we pray for health, we pray for happiness, and for the $300 I owe Maurice. We really are hoping for that to come through, If you could set that up. And,uh,we pray for understanding. as we all occasionally request back-door action by accident when we tried to call an electrician. It happens, It simply happens. And in your name we pray. Amen.

Amy-family: Amen.

Amy-mum: That was a very interesting prayer.

Tim: Thank you.

Tim: All right,let's just do this. Let's just have a nice dinner.

Tim: Whoops, there's Maurice.That didn't last long.

Tim: Hello?

Maurice: You don't let me upstairs, I'm gonna take your head and shove it through your asshole.

Tim: Safe to assume that's Maurice?

Debble: That's unmistakably Maurice.

Tim: That's classic Maurice.

Maurice: I'm waiting down here.

Tim: Maurice,I'm buzzing you in.

Amy: Who's Maurice?

Debble: Well, he says he works in financial retrieval,but that just means he's a pimp.

Amy: Okay,we're leaving.

Tim: You're leaving? What do you mean you're leaving? How's Maurice gonna feel?

Amy: Mom,Dad ...

Tim: He just got here.

Amy: Let's just go out for a nice dinner and then we'll get you back to your hotel.

Tim: This is crazy.

Amy-mum: It was a pleasure meeting you, Timothy.

Tim: The pleasure was all mine.

Amy-dad: If we never see each other again,son,good luck.

Tim: Never see each other again? What happened here?

Debble: You know,I think you made a better impression than you think.

Tim: You think I made a good impression?

Debble: Mmm-hmm,See,If you ask me, the fact that you vacuumed cancels out the back-door action.

Tim: I don't think it cancels it.

Debble: Well, maybe it--Whoops.

Maurice: You got my money,bitch?

Tim: What kind of entrance is that?

Maurice: I want cash in my hand.

Tim: I don't have it.

Maurice: What?

Tim: I don't have the money.

Maurice: Then we're gonna have to barter.

Tim: Barter?

Maurice: Let me see what I want in this place.

Tim: No

Maurice: TV sucks.

TIm: You cann't have that.

Maurice: Furniture sucks. Man, I don't want any of this junk. This place is brat,yo.

Tim: You want some meatloaf?

Maurice: What?

Tim: I can give you half of meatloaf.

Maurice: Come on,man.

Tim: You don't want it?

Maurice: NO.

Tim: You're not being reasonable. You're really--

Maurice: You better shut your mouth right now,son, and find my $300. You understand?

Tim: All right.Um ...

Tim: How about some clothes? I can give you this shirt.

Maurice: Can you honestly picture me wearing a shirt like that?

Tim: I can. No offense.

Tim: Your look is a little -- little expected.

Maurice: What did you say?

Tim: I just said it's like a parody. If this was a TV sitcom,the pimp would look like you.

Maurice: Maybe you got a point.

Tim: You know what? I think I do. Here,try my shirt on.

Maurice: All right.

Debble: Oh,that is precious.

Tim: That's working.

Maurice: You konw what? I think this is a good look for me.

Tim: That's a very good look.

Maurice: Yeah.

Tim: You could be a pimp or a CPA.

Maurice: I look hard in this.

Tim: It's nice.

Maurice: Check this angle. Bam!

Tim: Bam.

Maurice: Feel that?

Maurice: Watch this. I could slap too in this thing. Bam!

Debble: Bam!

Maurice: Slap you up,bitch. Give me my money.

Tim: Okay.

Maurice: Feels good. Feels good.

Tim: It looks good. It suits your job and your lifestyle.

Maurice: What you think,Debble? Do I look like a badass pimp?

Debble: Oh, with some nice chinos, I think you would.

Maurice: Those chino?

Debble: Mmm-hmm.

Tim: There? You want this?

Maurice: Yeah.

Tim: Let's do it.

Maurice: Why don't you take them pants off?

Tim: I'll take them off tight now if that makes this go away.

Tim: That's a good look.

Maurice: I think this might be a good look for me. I don't know,you know?

Tim: I mean,you don't find a lot of pimps shopping at The Gap ... or Banana Republic.

Maurice: You're right.

Debble: Tim, I think you did a very good job.

Tim: I'm glad it worked out.

Maurice: You might have changed my life. I got a dream now. You know what I'm saying? I feel good in there things.

Tim: This is emotional.

Maurice: You're a good guy.

Tim: Wow, you're not crying,are you?

Maurice: No,I'm not. I will shiv you quicker than you can blink.

Tim: All right, obviously you're not crying.

Maurice: I'm gonna show myself out.

Tim: All right. That worked out. That's nice. Happy ending.

Debble: Or as I like to say, back to the meatloaf.

Tim: Should I put something on?

Debble: No, I'm used to that look.

Tim: This dinner really took a weird --  a weird turn.

Debble: Didn't it though?

Tim: Yeah.

Debble: Yeah, I think it's nice, though. You're a very good host.

Tim: Thank you.

Debble: You know, Tim?

Tim: Yeah?

Debble: Most people have never treated me as nice as you have.

Tim: Well,I try to be nice.

Debble: Oh,you're very nice. Now I want to do something for you.

Tim: Okay.

Debble: How about ... a half price BJ?

Tim: No no

Debble: Doesn't that sound fun?

Tim: It actually does,but let's just not go there.

Debble: Okay,baby,I understand.

Debble: How about a little peck on the cheek?

Tim: You want to peck me on the cheek?

Debble: Yeah, or a hug?

Tim: That seems pretty innocent.

Debble: Okay. Come here.

Tim: Let's do that.

Tim: Okay,that's not a peck.

Amy: Tim?

Tim: Amy?

Debble: Hello.

Amy: What are you doing?

Tim: What am I doing or how am I doing?

Amy: What are you doing?

Tim: Listen, don't rush to judgment just because I'm nude and we're making out.

Amy: Unbelievable.

Tim: I vaccumed.
